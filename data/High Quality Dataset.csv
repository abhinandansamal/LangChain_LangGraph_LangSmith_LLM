8388,"Photosynthesis involves a complex set of reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, with oxygen as a waste product. The oxygen generated through photosynthesis is critical for nearly all other organisms on Earth as it provides the oxygen they need to undergo cellular respiration. Which of the following considerations provides the most scientifically robust evidence that photosynthesis evolved after cellular respiration?","The likelihood of photosynthesis evolving is extremely low due to its intricate multi-step process requiring multiple specialized structures like chloroplasts. Therefore, it is far more probable that the simpler process of cellular respiration evolved first.","Cellular respiration releases oxygen which would have been toxic before mechanisms for regulating oxygen levels from photosynthesis evolved. Thus, respiration must have emerged in an environment devoid of oxygen produced through photosynthesis.",The scientific evidence does not definitively favor either photosynthesis or respiration evolving first. Both pathways could have emerged through incremental evolutionary steps in early organisms.,"Geological evidence indicates there was abundant oxygen in the environment for hundreds of millions of years before complex organisms emerged. Therefore, photosynthetic mechanisms clearly evolved long before aerobic respiration.","Photosynthesis would not provide any evolutionary advantage until organisms emerged that could use the oxygen it produced. Therefore, it is most logical that anaerobic respiration evolved first followed by the oxygen producing photosynthesis. ",B
8389,"In an infamous thought experiment meant to highlight interpretational issues in quantum mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger describes a scenario in which a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive source, poison, and a Geiger counter rigged to break open the poison if the source decays. If the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is assumed correct, what can be definitively said about the state of the cat before the box is opened?","According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat exists in a superposition of alive and dead states until it is observed upon opening the box. Only then does the cat's wave function collapse into a definite alive or dead state.","Since the Copenhagen interpretation asserts that unobserved systems do not exist in definite states, it cannot be meaningfully said that the cat is either alive or dead before opening the box. Its state is undefined.","Because the box isolates any interactions between the outside environment and the cat, the Copenhagen interpretation cannot describe any definite state for the cat before it is observed.","The Copenhagen interpretation only applies to microscopic systems like atoms. It cannot be invoked to describe the state of a macroscopic system like a cat. Classically, the cat must be either alive or dead before the box is opened.","According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the radioactive trigger introduces fundamental uncertainty about whether the poison is released. Therefore, before opening the box, the cat must be considered to simultaneously exist in alive and dead states.",A

This implied the existence of penetrating natural radiation coming from space. Airborne measurements confirmed this.,Northern lights and other atmospheric effects could not be due to radiation from the sun. This unknown radiation was theorized to be cosmic radiation from space.
