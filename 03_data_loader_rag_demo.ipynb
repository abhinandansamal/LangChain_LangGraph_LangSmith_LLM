      "The fall of the Western Roman Empire is a complex and multifaceted event that took place over several centuries, but is traditionally dated to 476 AD when the last Roman emperor of the West, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer. There are many factors that contributed to the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire, including political, economic, social, and military causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key factors leading to the fall of the Western Roman Empire was political instability. After the death of Emperor Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD, the empire entered a period known as the Crisis of the Third Century, marked by frequent changes in leadership, civil wars, and usurpations. This weakened the authority of the central government and made the empire more vulnerable to external threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic troubles also played a significant role in the decline of the Western Roman Empire. The empire faced inflation, debasement of the currency, heavy taxation, and economic disparity between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses. The reliance on slave labor and the decline of small farmers also had a negative impact on the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social factors such as urban decay, moral decline, and the breakdown of traditional Roman values also contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The widespread use of slavery, the decline of the traditional Roman family structure, and the loss of civic virtue all weakened the social fabric of the empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Militarily, the Western Roman Empire faced increasing pressure from barbarian invasions along its borders. The Roman army, once a formidable fighting force, was weakened by internal divisions, lack of resources, and reliance on foreign mercenaries. The barbarian invasions, particularly by the Visigoths, Vandals, and Huns, further strained the empire's military resources and led to the sacking of Rome in 410 AD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a gradual process that involved a combination of internal weaknesses and external pressures. While the traditional date of 476 AD marks the end of Roman rule in the West, the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire, continued to exist for nearly a thousand years until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD.\n"

Imagine a customer unable to complete a transaction because an OTP never arrived, or missing a fraud alert that could have prevented unauthorized access to their account. These aren't just one-off incidents or minor inconveniences – they're critical failures that damage customer trust and potentially expose both customers and banks to financial risk.\\n\\nWhen we spoke with banking leaders across India, one concern came up repeatedly: message delivery reliability. From large private banks to rural cooperative banks, leaders expressed frustration with their current notification systems and the challenges of ensuring critical communications always reach their customers.\\n\\n![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clsli1s4n0010sbt4d6ctqt47/images/100percent-deliverability-blog-1743741306190-compressed.png)\\n\\nThe real cost of failed notifications\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nFailed banking notifications create ripple effects throughout the organization. When messages don't reach customers, it leads to:\\n\\n*   Financial losses for merchants when transactions can't be completed due to missing OTPs.\\n*   Increased support costs as customers flood call centers with inquiries about missing alerts.\\n*   Security vulnerabilities when fraud notifications fail to reach customers in time.\\n*   Regulatory non-compliance when mandatory communications aren't delivered.\\n*   Damaged trust when customers perceive the bank as unreliable.\\n\\nWhy banking notifications fail\\n------------------------------\\n\\nUnderstanding why notifications fail is the first step toward fixing the problem. Common failure points include:\\n\\n*   Single-vendor dependencies where outages create system-wide failures.\\n*   Network congestion during peak transaction periods.\\n*   Regional carrier issues that affect message delivery in specific areas.\\n*   International routing problems that impact customers traveling abroad.\\n*   Technical limitations of legacy communication systems.\\n\\nMost banks still rely on single-vendor systems or manual failover processes. When primary channels experience issues, there's no automatic mechanism to switch to alternative delivery methods. This significantly increases the risk of undelivered or delayed messages.\\n\\n### The case for 100% deliverability\\n\\nBanks that implement automated failover mechanisms report a 99.8% message delivery success rate, compared to 85-90% for those relying on single-vendor systems. This means automated failover can reduce message failures by up to 80%.\\n\\nBut achieving this level of reliability requires more than just implementing a backup system. It demands an intelligent, holistic approach to message delivery that can adapt in real-time to changing conditions.\\n\\nHow to achieve near-perfect message deliverability\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere are key strategies for banking leaders looking to achieve exceptional message deliverability:\\n\\n#### Implement intelligent routing with automatic failover\\n\\nCreate smart routing systems that can detect delivery failures in real-time and automatically switch to alternative channels. For example, if an SMS fails to deliver, the system should immediately attempt to reach the customer via WhatsApp, push notification, or email.\\n\\n#### Adopt an opti-channel approach\\n\\nRather than treating all messages equally, implement an opti-channel strategy that selects the optimal channel based on message type, urgency, and customer preferences. Critical security alerts might be sent simultaneously through multiple channels, while routine updates can follow a sequential approach starting with the most cost-effective option.\\n\\n#### Monitor delivery in real-time\\n\\nImplement comprehensive monitoring tools that track message delivery status across all channels. Real-time dashboards should highlight delivery issues as they occur, allowing for immediate intervention when necessary.\\n\\n#### Create redundancy at every level\\n\\nBuild redundancy into your messaging infrastructure by maintaining relationships with multiple vendors for each channel. This ensures that if one provider experiences issues, alternatives are readily available.\\n\\n#### Leverage data to optimize delivery\\n\\nUse analytics to understand which channels perform best for different customer segments and message types. Over time, this data can help optimize routing decisions to improve both deliverability and cost-efficiency.\\n\\nThe Fyno approach to 100% deliverability\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nModern communication platforms like Fyno are helping banks tackle these challenges through intelligent orchestration that automatically handles message routing, retries, and failovers.\\n\\nThe platform's sophisticated routing algorithms consider factors like message priority, cost optimization, customer preferences and channel performance to ensure optimal delivery paths. When a primary channel experiences issues, the system automatically initiates failover sequences to alternate channels, ensuring critical communications reach customers without delay.\\n\\nThis level of routing intelligence would require significant development effort to build in-house, but comes standard with modern customer communication management platforms like Fyno.\\n\\n### Getting started\\n\\nIf you're considering improving your bank's message deliverability, start with these steps:\\n\\n*   Assess your current delivery rates across different message types and channels.\\n*   Identify critical communications that require the highest reliability.\\n*   Evaluate your current vendor relationships and consider adding redundancy where needed.\\n*   Explore modern communication platforms like Fyno that offer intelligent routing and failover capabilities.\\n*   Document your requirements for an ideal notification system, including integration needs and compliance considerations.\\n\\nRemember, in banking, communication isn't just about staying in touch – it's about maintaining trust, and enabling smooth customer experiences. Achieving near-perfect deliverability is no longer optional; it's a strategic necessity in the digital banking era.\\n\\n\\n---\\nThis blog is powered by Superblog.

From data protection to message delivery, every aspect is governed by complex rules that change frequently. Meeting these requirements while delivering excellent customer service can be challenging.\\n\\nBased on our conversations with over 30 banks, we've identified the key regulatory challenges in customer communication and how Fyno's platform addresses them.\\n\\n![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clsli1s4n0010sbt4d6ctqt47/images/bank-regulations-blog-1743740596013-compressed.png)\\n\\n### The regulatory landscape for banking communications\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has implemented several guidelines that significantly impact how banks communicate with customers.\\n\\n#### RBI localization requirements\\n\\nRBI now requires banks to route customer communications through domestic channels rather than relying on international providers. This means banks must transition away from global communication platforms to local service providers while maintaining service quality.\\n\\nMany banks are actively reducing transactions via third-party CPaaS vendors and shifting towards direct integrations with telcos, as per RBI's recommendations. However, managing these integrations and ensuring real-time compliance remains a significant challenge for financial institutions.\\n\\n#### Data protection and privacy regulations\\n\\nThe Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) 2023 has established clear rules for handling customer data. Banks must obtain explicit consent before collecting or using personal information, and this consent must be specific and easy to withdraw.\\n\\nThe act requires secure methods for storing and processing data, with systems that can quickly detect and fix security breaches. Banks must also clearly explain why they're collecting data, how it will be used, and how long it will be kept.\\n\\n#### TRAI guidelines for messaging\\n\\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has specific rules for how banks send messages to customers:\\n\\nOnly send messages to users who have explicitly opted in. Maintain transparent audit trails with timestamps and delivery confirmations. Follow strict content regulations to ensure messages are appropriate.\\n\\n#### RBI cybersecurity framework\\n\\nThe RBI's cybersecurity framework requires banks to have a dedicated cybersecurity policy separate from their IT policies. This policy must address specific cyber threats with precision.\\n\\nBanks need to conduct continuous risk assessments, establish Security Operations Centers for real-time monitoring, and create robust incident response plans for managing cyber incidents. Board-level oversight is essential to make cybersecurity a core component of risk management.\\n\\n### The challenges banks face in meeting these regulations\\n\\nMeeting these regulations presents several challenges for banks:\\n\\n#### Fragmented communication systems\\n\\nMost banks use multiple vendors for different communication channels—SMS, WhatsApp, email, and more. This fragmentation makes it difficult to track compliance across channels and maintain a complete audit trail.\\n\\nMany banks are implementing centralized systems for two main reasons: to gain a unified view across multiple systems and to create comprehensive audit trails for compliance purposes.\\n\\n#### Security and data protection\\n\\nBanks struggle to protect customer data while maintaining efficient communication. Implementing end-to-end encryption, secure data storage, and continuous monitoring across fragmented systems is complex and resource-intensive.\\n\\n#### Adapting to changing regulations\\n\\nRegulations evolve rapidly, requiring banks to constantly update their systems. Without a flexible platform, these updates demand significant time and resources from IT teams.\\n\\n#### Managing consent and preferences\\n\\nBanks must track customer consent across all channels and ensure communications respect these preferences. This becomes especially challenging when different teams manage different channels.\\n\\nHow Fyno solves these regulatory challenges\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nFyno's modern customer communication management platform helps banks address these regulatory requirements through several key features:\\n\\n#### Unified API for all communication channels\\n\\nFyno provides a single API that connects with all communication channels, allowing banks to manage SMS, email, WhatsApp, and other channels from one platform. This creates a centralized view of all customer communications, making compliance monitoring and reporting much easier.\\n\\n#### Built-in compliance features\\n\\nThe platform includes native support for regulatory requirements like RBI localization, DPDP, and TRAI guidelines. Features such as comprehensive audit logs, consent management, and data masking help banks maintain compliance without additional development work.\\n\\n#### Centralized template management\\n\\nBanks can create, store, and manage all message templates in one place, ensuring consistent compliance across channels. The platform automatically enforces regulatory requirements for different message types.\\n\\n#### Real-time monitoring and analytics\\n\\nFyno provides detailed analytics on message delivery, engagement, and compliance. Banks can quickly identify and address any issues before they become regulatory concerns.\\n\\n#### End-to-end encryption and data protection\\n\\nThe platform includes robust security features like end-to-end encryption, data masking, and secure storage to protect customer information in accordance with DPDP requirements.\\n\\n#### Automated failover mechanisms\\n\\nFor critical messages like OTPs and transaction alerts, Fyno ensures delivery through intelligent failover systems that automatically switch channels if delivery fails. This helps banks meet regulatory requirements for important notifications.\\n\\n### Real results for banking institutions\\n\\nBanks that have implemented Fyno have seen significant improvements in regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.\\n\\nOne of the largest PSU banks in India reported saving 2-3 months of development effort and reducing engineering overhead by 80-90%. This allows their teams to focus on core banking innovations rather than maintaining their\\xa0 communication infrastructure.\\n\\n### The future of regulatory compliance in banking communication\\n\\nAs regulations continue to evolve, banks need a solution that can adapt quickly. Fyno's continuous innovation ensures that banks can meet new requirements without major system overhauls.\\n\\nThe platform's AI-driven features will help banks anticipate regulatory needs and optimize their communication strategies accordingly. From smart channel selection to dynamic budget optimization, these capabilities help banks stay compliant while delivering excellent customer experiences.\\n\\nBy partnering with Fyno, banks can transform regulatory compliance from a burden into a competitive advantage, ensuring that their customer communications are secure, compliant, and effective in the ever-changing regulatory landscape.\\n\\n\\n---\\nThis blog is powered by Superblog.

Yet most banks struggle with fragmented messaging systems that fail at critical moments. Your customer gets a payment confirmation via email but misses a fraud alert because your service provider had failed or it was sent to a communication channel that your customers barely use. Every missed or delayed notification doesn't just inconvenience your customer – it can lead to cascading financial issues and damaged relationships.\\xa0\\n\\n![](https://superblog.supercdn.cloud/site_cuid_clsli1s4n0010sbt4d6ctqt47/images/4-reasons-why-fyno-is-a-great-fit-for-banks-1-1743136327983-compressed.png)\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\u200b  \\n\\nLeading banks have discovered that solving this challenge requires more than just another tool. They understood that they need a comprehensive platform designed specifically for the unique demands of financial communications. This is especially true as customers increasingly expect real-time updates across multiple channels – from traditional SMS to WhatsApp and beyond.\\n\\nThat's why forward-thinking banks are turning to specialized platforms like Fyno that are purpose-built for financial institutions. If you're wondering what makes Fyno the go-to choice for banks and others in the BFSI sector, we don't have one, but five reasons. Here they are!\\n\\n100% deliverability: Never miss a critical banking alert\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBanking communications aren't optional—they're essential. When a suspicious transaction occurs, that alert needs to reach your customer immediately, regardless of network issues or channel limitations.\\n\\nFyno's intelligent routing ensures your messages always find their destination. If a fraud alert sent via SMS fails to deliver, the system automatically tries WhatsApp. If that fails, it moves to email or push notifications. This smart failover happens in seconds, ensuring time-sensitive banking alerts never fall through the cracks.\\n\\nFor international banks, this capability becomes even more valuable. Banks with global operations face the challenge of navigating diverse telecom ecosystems and customer preferences across countries. Fyno solves this by enabling messages to be routed through local telecom providers in each region, optimizing for deliverability and cost.\\n\\nThe platform also adapts to channel preferences by country – using WhatsApp in regions where it dominates, SMS where it's preferred, or even RCS in supported markets. Whether it's a transaction confirmation in London routed through a UK telecom provider via SMS or a payment reminder in India delivered through WhatsApp, your message gets through using the most effective local channel and provider.\\n\\nAdheres to all compliance frameworks\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nBanking is one of the most heavily regulated industries, with communication requirements varying dramatically across regions. What's compliant in one country might violate regulations in another.\\n\\nFyno simplifies this regulatory maze with built-in compliance tools designed specifically for financial institutions. The platform manages communication preferences, consent tracking, and DND (Do Not Disturb) restrictions automatically across all channels. This means you can send account updates, promotional offers, and security alerts without worrying about violating messaging regulations.\\n\\nFor banks operating in India, Fyno even streamlines the complex DLT registration process for SMS messages. Instead of managing approvals across multiple telecom portals, you can handle everything from a single interface. This reduces the administrative burden while ensuring all your messages remain compliant.\\n\\nBank-grade security for sensitive communications\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFinancial messages contain some of the most sensitive customer information. Account balances, transaction details, and nominee information, etc. that require protection at every step of the delivery process.\\n\\nFyno was built with bank-grade security from the ground up. The platform offers advanced encryption for messages in transit and at rest, protecting customer data from unauthorized access. Sophisticated user controls let you limit who can create, approve, and send different types of communications within your organization.\\n\\nThe platform's data masking and hashing capabilities provide an additional layer of protection. Sensitive information like account numbers can be automatically masked in logs and reports, reducing the risk of exposure during analysis and troubleshooting. This comprehensive security approach helps banks maintain customer trust while meeting their communication goals.\\n\\nReal-time visibility into messaging performance\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nMost banks are flying blind when it comes to communication performance. They know messages are being sent, but they can't tell which ones are actually reaching customers or driving engagement.\\n\\nFyno's powerful analytics dashboard gives you complete visibility into your messaging ecosystem. Track delivery rates, open rates, and response times across all channels from a single interface. See which message types generate the most customer engagement and which ones might need improvement.\\n\\nFor banks sending high volumes of transaction notifications, this visibility is game-changing. You can quickly identify delivery patterns, spot potential issues before they affect customers, and optimize your communication strategy based on actual performance data. This level of insight helps you deliver a more consistent, effective customer experience while reducing support costs related to missed or confusing communications.\\n\\nBanks that switch to Fyno typically see dramatic improvements in their communication effectiveness. Not only do critical messages reach customers more reliably, but the entire process becomes more efficient. Engineering teams spend less time maintaining communication infrastructure and more time building core banking features that drive growth.\\n\\nZero engineering bottlenecks with no-code workflows\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor most banks, making changes to customer communication systems is a painful process. Adding a new notification type or changing an SMS provider often requires weeks of planning, coding, and testing – pulling valuable engineering resources away from core banking features.\\n\\nFyno eliminates these bottlenecks with its intuitive no-code workflow builder. Banking teams can design sophisticated communication flows, modify message templates, and even change service providers without writing a single line of code. This means your product teams can update communication strategies without waiting for engineering sprints or deployment windows.\\n\\nThe platform's unified API approach further reduces engineering overhead. Instead of building and maintaining separate integrations for each communication channel, your team only needs to integrate once with Fyno. When you want to add a new channel like WhatsApp or switch SMS providers, these changes happen in the Fyno interface – not in your codebase.\\n\\nBanks using Fyno typically report dramatic reductions in engineering effort. One financial services customer mentioned saving 2-3 months of development effort and 80-90% of continuous engineering effort after implementing the platform. This means your technical teams can focus on building innovative banking features rather than maintaining communication infrastructure.\\n\\nIn today's banking environment, seamless communication isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential for maintaining customer trust and satisfaction. With Fyno, banks can deliver the reliable, secure, and compliant messaging experience their customers expect.\\n\\n\\n---\\nThis blog is powered by Superblog.

To address these shortcomings, we propose AdapterFusion, a new two stage learning algorithm that leverages knowledge from multiple tasks. First, in the knowledge extraction stage we learn task specific parameters called adapters, that encapsulate the task-specific information. We then combine the adapters in a separate knowledge composition step. We show that by separating the two stages, i.e., knowledge extraction and knowledge composition, the classifier can effectively exploit the representations learned from multiple tasks in a non-destructive manner. We empirically evaluate AdapterFusion on 16 diverse NLU tasks, and find that it effectively combines various types of knowledge at different layers of the model. We show that our approach outperforms traditional strategies such as full fine-tuning as well as multi-task learning. Our code and adapters are available at AdapterHub.ml'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/corpus_metadata.csv', 'row': 1}, page_content='filename: Attention_Is_All_You_Need.pdf\\ntitle: Attention Is All You Need\\nabstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data'),\n",

Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations'),\n",

We present mBART – a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019). mBART is the first method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, while previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly fine tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task-specific modifications. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show it also enables new types of transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/corpus_metadata.csv', 'row': 4}, page_content='filename: Parameter-Efficient_Transfer_Learning_with_Adapters.pdf\\ntitle: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP\\nabstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter’s effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/corpus_metadata.csv', 'row': 5}, page_content='filename: Simple_Scalable_Adaptation_for_Neural_Machine_Translation.pdf\\ntitle: Simple, Scalable Adaptation for Neural Machine Translation\\nabstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models is the dominant approach for adapting to new languages and domains. However, fine-tuning requires adapting and maintaining a separate model for each target task. We propose a simple yet efficient approach for adaptation in NMT. Our proposed approach consists of injecting tiny task specific adapter layers into a pre-trained model. These lightweight adapters, with just a small fraction of the original model size, adapt the model to multiple individual tasks simultaneously. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) Domain Adaptation and (ii) Massively Multilingual NMT. Experiments on domain adaptation demonstrate that our proposed approach is on par with full fine-tuning on various domains, dataset sizes and model capacities. On a massively multilingual dataset of 103 languages, our adaptation approach bridges the gap between individual bilingual models and one massively multilingual model for most language pairs, paving the way towards universal machine translation'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/corpus_metadata.csv', 'row': 6}, page_content='filename: Transformers_for_Low-Resource_Languages_Is_Feidir_Linn.pdf\\ntitle: Transformers for Low-Resource Languages: Is Feidir Linn!\\nabstract: The Transformer model is the state-of-the-art in Machine Translation. However, in general, neural translation models often under perform on language pairs with insufficient training data. As a consequence, relatively few experiments have been carried out using this architecture on low-resource language pairs. In this study, hyperparameter optimization of Transformer models in translating the low-resource English-Irish language pair is evaluated. We demonstrate that choosing appropriate parameters leads to considerable performance improvements. Most importantly, the correct choice of subword model is shown to be the biggest driver of translation performance. SentencePiece models using both unigram and BPE approaches were appraised. Variations on model architectures included modifying the number of layers, testing various regularisation techniques and evaluating the optimal number of heads for attention. A generic 55k DGT corpus and an in-domain 88k public admin corpus were used for evaluation. A Transformer optimized model demonstrated a BLEU score improvement of 7.8 points when compared with a baseline RNN model. Improvements were observed across a range of metrics, including TER, indicating a substantially reduced post editing effort for Transformer optimized models with 16k BPE subword models. Bench-marked against Google Translate, our translation engines demonstrated significant improvements. The question of whether or not Transformers can be used effectively in a low-resource setting of English-Irish translation has been addressed. Is feidir linn - yes we can'),\n",

We train a Transformerbased masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6% average accuracy on XNLI, +13% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4% F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing perlanguage performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code, data and models publicly available'),\n",

For example, the latest techniques have improved the state-of-the-art performance on the XTREME multilingual benchmark by more than 13 points. While a sizeable gap to humanlevel performance remains, improvements have been easier to achieve in some tasks than in others. This paper analyzes the current state of cross-lingual transfer learning and summarizes some lessons learned. In order to catalyze meaningful progress, we extend XTREME to XTREME-R, which consists of an improved set of ten natural language understanding tasks, including challenging language-agnostic retrieval tasks, and covers 50 typologically diverse languages. In addition, we provide a massively multilingual diagnostic suite (MULTICHECKLIST) and finegrained multi-dataset evaluation capabilities through an interactive public leaderboard to gain a better understanding of such models'),\n",

Character ngrams have already been used as a part of more complex metrics, but their individual potential has not been investigated yet. We report system-level correlations with human rankings for 6-gram F1-score (CHRF) on the WMT12, WMT13 and WMT14 data as well as segment-level correlation for 6- gram F1 (CHRF) and F3-scores (CHRF3) on WMT14 data for all available target languages. The results are very promising, especially for the CHRF3 score – for translation from English, this variant showed the highest segment-level correlations outperforming even the best metrics on the WMT14 shared evaluation task')]"

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

       "'Nikola Tesla (; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American engineer, futurist, and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\\nBorn and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.\\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla\\'s work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.\\n\\n\\n== Early years ==\\n\\nNikola Tesla was born into an ethnic Serb family in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia), on 10 July 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church. His father\\'s brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.\\nTesla\\'s mother, Georgina \"Đuka\" Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother\\'s genetics and influence.\\nTesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse-riding accident when Tesla was aged six or seven. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla\\'s father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual t'"
